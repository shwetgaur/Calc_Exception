# Java Calculator Application


## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This is a simple **Java-based Calculator Application** that supports the following operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Square
- Cube
- Square Root

Each functionality is implemented in its own Java class file, following modular programming principles and clean code practices.

## ðŸ’¡ Features & Functionalities

| Functionality     | Description                                                |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `add(a, b)`       | Returns the sum of two numbers.                            |
| `subtract(a, b)`  | Returns the result of subtracting second number from first.|
| `multiply(a, b)`  | Returns the product of two numbers.                        |
| `divide(a, b)`    | Returns the quotient; handles division by zero exception. |
| `square(a)`       | Returns the square of a number.                            |
| `cube(a)`         | Returns the cube of a number.                              |
| `sqrt(a)`         | Returns the square root; handles invalid input exception.  |

## ðŸ§  Exception Handling

To ensure smooth and crash-free execution, the application makes use of various inbuilt Java exceptions:

- `ArithmeticException`: To handle division by zero.
- `InputMismatchException`: To manage invalid inputs.
- `IllegalArgumentException`: To handle negative values for square root operations.

## ðŸ›  Code Structure

The program consists of the following files:

- `Main.java` â€“ Entry point of the program.
- `Addition.java` â€“ Contains method to add two numbers.
- `Subtraction.java` â€“ Contains method to subtract two numbers.
- `Multiplication.java` â€“ Contains method to multiply two numbers.
- `Division.java` â€“ Contains method to divide two numbers.
- `Square.java` â€“ Contains method to calculate square of a number.
- `Cube.java` â€“ Contains method to calculate cube of a number.
- `SquareRoot.java` â€“ Contains method to calculate square root of a number.

Each file and function is committed separately in the GitHub repository.
